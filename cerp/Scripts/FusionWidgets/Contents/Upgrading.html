    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>This section is meant for users who have 
        implemented Instrumentation v2 in their applications, and are now upgrading 
        to FusionWidgets v3.</p>
      <p>Due to the extensive set of new features introduced in FusionWidgets v3, it's not 100% backward compatible with Instrumentation v2 on the cosmetics side. On the functional side, FusionWidgets v3 is mostly backward compatible. That means, when you replace your Instrumentation v2 SWFs with FusionWidgets v3 SWF files, you'll find that the chart functions correctly, but there will be visual changes between your original and new chart. </p>
      <p>To upgrade from Instrumentation v2 to FusionWidgets v3 charts, you'll need to undertake the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Replace v2 SWF with the new v3 SWF Files (present in <span class="codeInline">Download 
          Package &gt; Charts</span> folder). </li>
        <li>Either rename the v3 SWF files to use old v2 SWF names or update 
          your code to use new SWF names.</li>
        <li>You may also want to update your code to use the FusionCharts JavaScript class to embed charts.</li>
        <li> Clear your browser cache and view the chart. </li>
        <li>You might now find that your charts aren't looking the way they used to. You'll have to tweak some attributes to get back to v2 look.  </li>
        <li>To use the new features of v3 charts, you'll have to add the required attributes/elements to the XML document. </li>
      </ol></td>
