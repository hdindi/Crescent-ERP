Unlike previous versions, where you had to load pre-compiled chart SWFs at run-time, you can now include the respective chart's class at design-time and then compile it with your application to form a single comprehensive unit. </p>
      <p class="highlightBlock">To load FusionWidgets v3 in your Flash movies, <strong>you need to make sure that your Flash movies are also in Flash 8 format  and uses ActionScript 2.</strong> This is because FusionWidgets is coded in ActionScript 2/Flash 8 and intensively makes use of features provided in Flash 8. </p>

      <p>XML data can be easily created in your Flash movies either using string concatenation or using methods of the XML Object. You do not need to store data in physical XML files. You can build the XML data in Flash variables at run-time and then pass this to chart. So, even if you've your data in arrays, recordsets or remote database (that you access using your own Flash code), you can easily convert them to XML at run-time and then use FusionWidgets with it. </p>
      <p>We won't be discussing XML data structure here, as that has already been discussed in each chart's XML sheet.</p>
      <p>Here, we'll directly jump to see how to create a FusionWidgets chart in your Flash application. We'll start with a very basic single gauge application. </p></td>

      <p class="highlightBlock">The code examples discussed in this section are present in <span class="codeInline">Download Package &gt; Code &gt; FlashExamples</span>.</p>
    <p>Now, before we code to create the charts, we need to set (install) the charts  for use in this movie. Setting up the charts for use in your movie is very simple. You just need to copy <span class="codeInline">com</span> folder from <span class="codeInline">Download Package &gt; SourceCode</span> folder into the folder in which you'll be placing your .fla file. Here,  we're placing our <span class="codeInline">.fla</span> file in <span class="codeInline">FlashExamples</span> folder, and as such we copy the <span class="codeInline">com</span> folder here.</p>
    <p class="highlightBlock"><span class="codeInline">com</span> folder is the package for FusionWidgets v3 Class files. It contains all the files required to generate any chart in FusionWidgets v3. <br />
      <br />
      Individual chart class files are present in <span class="codeInline">com &gt; fusioncharts &gt; is &gt; core &gt; charts</span> folder. If you feel that you just need to plot a few charts in your movie, you can delete the rest of Chart Class files from this folder. <br />
      <br />
      There are lot of other folders under <span class="codeInline">com &gt; fusioncharts &gt; is</span> folder. These files are required by FusionWidgets to create the chart. </p>
    <p>Now that the charts are set for use, let's get back to our Flash file. Rename the default layer as &quot;<span class="codeInline">Graphic Elements</span>&quot; and place an oval shape with shadow effect. Basically, we'll use this as the background of the chart. The idea is to show how easily FusionWidgets can integrate with the graphical elements of your Flash movie. It should look something as under: </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Let's get to the above code step by step. To include any FusionWidgets chart in your Flash movie, you first need to include two files in your movie: <span class="codeInline">com/fusioncharts/is/includes/LoadingFunctions.as</span> and <span class="codeInline">com/fusioncharts/is/includes/AppMessages.as</span>. These files contain necessary pre-load functions and application messages for the chart. In your application, you can put this code in the main timeline, so that it gets executed only once.</p>
      <p>After this, we include the Chart Class file of the chart which we intend to plot. All Chart Classes are present in <span class="codeInline">com &gt; fusioncharts &gt; is &gt;  core &gt; charts </span>folder. So, the package name of each chart class is <span class="codeInline">com.fusioncharts.is.core.charts</span>. Here, we're building a basic angular gauge, and as such the fully qualified class name is <span class="codeInline">com.fusioncharts.is.core.charts.AngularGauge</span>.</p>
      <p>Once the classes are imported, we set our focus to building the XML data for the chart. In this example, we're using an angular gauge. So, the XML structure has to be that of angular gauge. We build the XML using string concatenation in the variable <span class="codeInline">strXML</span>. Here, we're hard-coding the XML data in this string variable. In your real world application, this data could come from a database, web service, recordset etc. All you would need to do is get the appropriate data and then encode it into XML using string concatenation or XML Object (though string concatenation is far easier to use and understand). Finally, we create an XML Object from this xml string, as FusionWidgets accepts only XML Objects. </p>
      <p>Moving on , let's see how to build the chart now. Each FusionWidgets chart needs an empty movie clip to build itself in. So, we create an empty movie clip named as <span class="codeInline">ChartHolder</span>. We store the reference to this movie clip in <span class="codeInline">chartContainerMC</span> variable. For demonstration purposes, we've created this empty movie clip in <span class="codeInline">_level0</span> at depth 1. In your applications, you can create it nested within any movie clip.</p>
      <p class="codeInline">var chartContainerMC:MovieClip = this.createEmptyMovieClip(&quot;ChartHolder&quot;,1);</p>
    <p>After that, we come to the main line of code - the line that instantiates the chart object. </p>
    <p class="codeInline">var myFirstChart:AngularGauge = new AngularGauge(chartContainerMC, 1, 450, 220, 20, 15, false, false, &quot;&quot;, &quot;EN&quot;, &quot;noScale&quot;);    </p>
    <p>Here, we're creating an instance of <span class="codeInline">AngularGauge</span> class in our local variable <span class="codeInline">myFirstChart</span>. <span class="codeInline">myFirstChart</span> now stores the reference of the angular gauge that we intend to display in this movie.
