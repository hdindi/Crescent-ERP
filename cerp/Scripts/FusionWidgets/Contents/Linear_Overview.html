      <p>The FusionWidgets linear gauge is a real-time gauge, which can   update it's data at every specified interval, without requiring any page   refreshes.</p>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>The linear gauge chart is used to display a specific data point utilizing a   pointer that moves on a horizontal named color scale to indicate whether the   monitored data is within defined limits. Colors can be selected for background   to suit the application such as green for satisfactory, yellow for caution and   red for alarm.</p>
      <p>The chart is defined by minimum and maximum values. Within that scale you can   create various ranges to classify your data. Its purpose is to classify that   value as belonging to a predetermined range. For example, you might define a   range called &ldquo;Best&rdquo; that consists of values between 60 and 100. Or you might   create a range called &ldquo;Weak&rdquo; that consists of values between 30 and 60. For each   range, you define a color, which helps visually distinguish the ranges from each   other.</p>
      <p>The configuration options allow you to configure it into just about any kind   of sliding gauge, meter, or mechanism for output. Ideal uses for linear gauge   chart are factory/instrument gauges, range meter, slider, tank or vessel fill   indicator, Pipe, Volt/Amp/Ohm Meter to name just a few.</p>
      <p>To create a FusionCharts Linear Gauge chart, you need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide the lower limit and upper limit for the chart. </li>
        <li>Decide the visual properties of the chart </li>
        <li>Decide the color range for the chart. That is, suppose you are plotting a   chart to show the magnitude of severity of an Earthquake on a Richter scale, the   color range would be:<br />
          0-2 &ndash; Micro &ndash; Green<br />
          2-6 &ndash; Moderate - Yellow<br />
          6-9 &ndash;   Strong - Red </li>
        <li>Decide the chart value </li>
      </ul>
