    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Angular gauges are essentially like the speedometer or fuel gauge of your   car. They use a radial scale to display your data range and a dial is used to   indicate the data value. </p>
      <p>An angular/meter/dial gauge chart is used to display a specific data set   utilizing an indicator that moves within a circular range to indicate whether   the monitored data is within defined limits. Colors can be selected for the data   range to suit the application such as green for satisfactory, yellow for caution   and red for alarm.</p>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>As you can see in all the charts, the chart is defined by minimum and maximum   values (referred to as lower limit and upper limit). Within that scale, you can create various qualitative ranges (color range) to classify your data.   Its purpose is to classify that value as belonging to a predetermined range. For   example, you might define a range called &ldquo;Best&rdquo; that consists of values between   60 and 100. Or you might create a range called &ldquo;Weak&rdquo; that consists of values   between 30 and 60. For each range, you define a color, which helps visually   distinguish the ranges from each other.</p>
    <p>To create a FusionWidgets Angular Gauge chart, you need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decide the lower and upper limit of chart. </li>
      <li>Decide the cosmetic and functional properties of the chart </li>
      <li>Decide the color range for the chart. That is, suppose you are plotting a   chart to show the production output of a factory, the color range could   be:<br />
        0-100 pieces/hr &ndash; Under Average &ndash; Red<br />
        100-200 pieces/hr &ndash; Average   Production - Yellow<br />
        200-300 pieces/hr &ndash; Very good - Green </li>
      <li>Decide trend points if any &ndash; for example, if you would like to mark an   average at say 175 - say &ldquo;Last week&rsquo;s average production&rdquo;, you can use trend   points to do the same. </li>
      <li>Decide the chart value(s). FusionWidgets allows you to indicate multiple   values on the angular gauge chart. All you have to do is decide the value each   spindle/dial would indicate and the width and color of each one of them. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s study the anatomy of an angular gauge chart before we move to the XML   structure of the chart.</p></td>
