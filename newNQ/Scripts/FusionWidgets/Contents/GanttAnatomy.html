    <td valign="top" class="header">Categories and sub-categories (dates) on the visual timeline </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>      A Gantt chart is constructed with a horizontal axis representing the total time span of the project, broken down into increments (for example, days, weeks, or months). FusionWidgets Gantt chart allows you to define any number of sub-categories to show dates broken into smaller units.</p>
      <p>For example, if you were to show a Gantt Chart spanning 2 years, you can show the first sub-category as quarters, then divide these quarters into months, then weeks, and finally into days. This is all possible with FusionWidgets Gantt Chart.</p>
      <p>Irregular distribution of the timeline is also possible. For example, if you want to plot a Gantt chart illustrating the development of a   certain project during a 3 months time span and you want to show weekly   progress, you can easily divide the time period into weeks based on their actual   dates to show the true progress. In the visual date timeline, the top bar could   represent the 3 months by their names, and the bar below it could display the   weeks. </p>
      <p>In most of the other Gantt charts, you&rsquo;re forced to divide a month into 4   weeks only, thereby resulting to aberrations in visual data display, as a month   always is more than 4 weeks. But since FusionWidgets Gantt chart is date   based, all your divisions of date are perfect. You can therefore show a week   starting in one month and ending in other.<br />

FusionWidgets allows you to   create your own milestones on the chart based on date and task i.e., for a given   task you can specify milestones on specific dates, and you can customize all the   visual properties of the milestone including shape (star or polygon), size and   colors. </p>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>FusionWidgets Gantt chart allows you to draw connectors between your task bars to   indicate the flow of the entire process. </p>
    <p>On the functional side, to draw a   connector, all you need to do is specify the Id of the two tasks, which you want   to connect. Apart from this, you can also specify where the connector joins the   start and end task bar individually &ndash; at their start or end. </p>
    <p>For example, if you   need to plot two connecting tasks which are simultaneous in nature, that is each   process starts at the same time and relates to the same thing, you can connect   the start of task bar to the start of end bar to give the visual effect.   Similarly, if the second process can start only after the first process has   ended, you can connect the end of first task bar to the start of succeeding task   bar.</p></td>
