Every n seconds (specified as <span class="codeInline">refreshInterval</span>), the chart polls the server, retrieves new data and updates itself. </p>
      <p>FusionWidgets data-streaming charts also allow you to set different update and refresh interval for the chart. </p>
      <p><strong>Update interval</strong> indicates the polling interval when data is retrieved from server and queued for update, but not applied on chart. <strong>Refresh interval </strong>means application of this queued data on the chart i.e., the chart is re-drawn to show all data contained in its queue. </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Let us consider a case where you are showing the real-time CPU Usage using line chart. Here, you want the chart to fetch updated data every 5 seconds, but want to refresh its view state (drawing) every 30 seconds only. To do so, you can set:</p>
      <p class="codeInline">&lt;chart .... updateInterval='5' refreshInterval='30' ...&gt;</p>
    <p>The above attributes instruct the chart to keep fetching new data every 5 seconds. However, the new data is not applied on the chart every 5 seconds. Instead, it's stored in the chart data storage.</p>
    <p>After every 30 seconds, the chart is refreshed with historical data and the new data that has been collected over the past  30 seconds. </p>
    <p>This method helps you save a lot of resources when you do not want to miss regular updates, but also do not want to strain the end user's machine by refreshing the chart at such a small interval. </p></td>
