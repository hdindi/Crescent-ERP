    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>When trying to make a chart using FusionWidgets, 
        if you get any errors (or if the chart doesn't render), there could a 
        lot of reasons for it. Here, we'll try and cover them up. We've divided 
        the entire debugging process into two sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic Troubleshooting - Manual problem solving methods.</li>
        <li>Using the Debug Mode - FusionWidgets v3 introduces the new Debug Window 
          Mode, which helps you un-earth the problems with your chart. We'll cover 
          that in next page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's get to basic trouble shooting first. While creating your chart, 
        if for some reasons you do not see your chart like it should, check for 
        the following actions:</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="header">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="header">SWF Movie not Loading or No chart shown</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>When viewing your page containing the chart, 
        if you see an endless loading progress bar in your browser, or if the 
        right click menu (right click at the place where the chart is supposed 
        to be) shows &quot;<span class="codeInline">Movie not loaded</span>&quot;, 
        check the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check if the SWF path is properly provided in your HTML page is correct. 
          Also, check if the SWF file actually exists there.</li>
        <li>If you're working on a case-sensitive file system Operating System, 
          check for the case of path and SWF file.</li>
        <li>Check if you've Adobe Flash Player 8 (or above) installed on your 
          machine. </li>
        <li>Check whether you've enabled your browser to show ActiveX controls. 
          Normally, all browsers are Flash-enabled. </li>
      </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="header">&quot;Error in Loading Data&quot; message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>If you get an &quot;Error in Loading Data&quot; 
        message in your chart, it means that FusionWidgets could not find XML data 
        at the specified URL. In that case, check the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check if you've actually provided <span class="codeInline">dataURL</span> 
          or <span class="codeInline">dataXML</span>. If you do not provide either, 
          FusionWidgets looks for a default <span class="codeInline">Data.xml </span>file 
          in the same path. However, if that is also not found, it shows the &quot;<span class="codeInline">Error 
          in Loading Data</span>&quot; error. </li>
        <li>If you're using <span class="codeInline">dataURL</span> method, paste 
          this URL in your browser to check if it's returning a valid XML. Make 
          sure there are no scripting or time-out errors and a valid XML is being 
          returned. Also make sure that the XML isn't intermingled with HTML content. 
          The data provider page should return clean XML only - not even HTML 
          <span class="codeInline">&lt;head&gt;</span> or <span class="codeInline">&lt;body&gt;</span> 
          tags.</li>
        <li>If you've to pass parameters to your <span class="codeInline">dataURL</span> 
          data provider page from FusionWidgets, make sure they're URLEncoded in 
          the dataURL, when providing to FusionCharts. e.g., if your dataURL needs 
          to be<span class="codeInline"> Data.asp?id=43&amp;subId=454</span>, 
          you'll need to URL Encode it so that it becomes <span class="codeInline">Data%2Easp%3Fid%3D43%26subId%3D454</span>. 
          Only then FusionWidgets will invoke the URL with proper parameters appended 
          to it.</li>
        <li>When using <span class="codeInline">dataURL</span> method, make sure 
          that the SWF File and data provider page are on the same sub-domain. 
          Due to Flash's sandbox security model, it cannot access data from external 
          domains, unless otherwise configured. </li>
      </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="header">&quot;Invalid XML Data&quot; message</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>If you get an &quot;Invalid XML Data&quot; 
        message, it means that the XML data document is malformed. Check it again 
        for common errors like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Difference in case of tags. <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart&gt;</span> 
          should end with <span class="codeInline">&lt;/chart&gt;</span> and <strong>not</strong> 
          <span class="codeInline">&lt;/Chart&gt;</span> or<span class="codeInline"> 
          &lt;/CHART&gt;</span></li>
        <li>Missing opening/closing quotation marks for any attributes. e.g., 
          <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart caption=Monthly Sales' </span>should 
          be <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart caption='Monthly Sales'</span></li>
        <li>Missing closing tag for any element.</li>
        <li>If you're using any special characters in your XML, make sure they're 
          properly encoded. Like, in <span class="codeInline">dataXML</span> method, 
          % needs to be encoded as %25, &amp; as %26 and so on. In <span class="codeInline">dataURL</span> 
          method, you can provide most of the characters directly, without the 
          need to encode.</li>
        <li>In <span class="codeInline">dataXML</span> method, check for conflict 
          of ' (XML Attribute Character) and &quot; (HTML Parameter Character). 
          For example, if you're using <span class="codeInline">direct HTML embedding</span> 
          method, and using &quot; for HTML parameters, then you need to make 
          sure that all your XML attributes use ' as containers. Example: <span class="codeInline">&lt;param 
          name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;&lt;chart showLabels='1' showValues='1'&gt;...&lt;/chart&gt;&quot; 
          /&gt;</span></li>
        <li>If you've quotes as part of your data, XML Encode them to<span class="codeInline"> 
          &amp;apos;</span> Example: <span class="codeInline">&lt;set name='John&amp;apos;s 
          House' /&gt;</span></li>
        <li>To get more information on what the error in XML is, you can either 
          use the Debug Window (explained next) or open the XML in your browser.        </li>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>If your chart shows a &quot;No data to display&quot; 
        message, it could be the following scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your XML data doesn't contain any data that could be plotted by FusionWidgets. 
          In this case, your XML just contains the <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart&gt;</span> 
          or <span class="codeInline">&lt;dataset&gt;</span> tags without any 
          data between them.</li>
        <li>You might be using a single-series chart SWF and providing data in 
          multi-series format or vice-versa. In this case too, you'll get &quot;No 
          data to display&quot; message.</li>
        <li>In some Dual Y Combination charts, you need to provide atleast one 
          data-set for both the axis. Otherwise, you'll get a &quot;No data to 
          display&quot; message.</li>
      </ul>      </td>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><ul>
      <li>You've set <span class="codeInline">registerWithJS</span> flag as 1 in the chart's constructor method.</li>
      <li>You've not placed the chart inside a <span class="codeInline">FORM</span> element. When the chart is inside a <span class="codeInline">FORM</span> element, the browser cannot access the chart using DOM.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you're not calling the JavaScript method before the chart has loaded and rendered. You need to use <span class="codeInline">FC_Rendered</span> function of chart to track the loading of chart as explained in the section &quot;FusionWidgets and JavaScript&quot;</li>
      <li> Make sure that you're NOT running the chart from local file system (C:\ , D:\). Instead, run the chart from behind a server (localhost - IIS, Apache etc.). This is because the Flash Player security settings do not allow chart to JavaScript interaction on local file system by default, unless otherwise specifically set.</li>
